# Installing 5zig on vanilla Minecraft
**Note: this is only supported in Minecraft 1.15.2 and below.**

First, make sure that both the launcher and the game are closed.

To install 5zig on vanilla Minecraft, run (by double-clicking) the JAR file you've downloaded.  
If you get a prompt similar to "Choose a program to open this file" and there's no Java option, [download Java](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).  
If it opens the file with WinRAR or another archive extractor, right-click the file instead and select "Run > Java" (or similar). If Java doesn't appear, download it from the link above.

Once you've installed 5zig, open the launcher and select the 5zig profile (if it's not already selected).
