This file allows you to install 5zig either on vanilla or as a Forge mod.

# Installing 5zig on vanilla Minecraft
See the [dedicated guide](install-vanilla.md).

# Installing 5zig on Forge
**Note: this is only supported in Minecraft 1.8.9 and 1.12.2.**
If you download the Forge version all you need to do is put the file (do not run it) into your `.minecraft/mods` folder and run the game with Forge.
