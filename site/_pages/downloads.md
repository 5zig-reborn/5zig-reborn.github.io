They contain the latest features and fixes, but may also contain bugs.

## Latest stable Release
These releases are handpicked and considered to be the most stable when a milestone was reached.  
However, you should use the [latest build](#latest-build) instead.

## Cape-Template
5zig Reborn allows Tier 2 Patreons to upload their own custom capes and elytra styles which can even be animated!

Animated capes and elytras use the same format as animated textures in Resource packs do, which is having each "frame" as another part below the previous one.  
The animation is at a speed set by the mod.

The button below allows you to download a Zip-File containing files for making static and animated cape and elytra textures.  
Available are files for Gimp, Paint.net and Photoshop. The raw PNG files are also provided.

## How to Install
Don't know how to install 5zig? These guides can help you!

### Vanilla
> **Note:**  
> This is only supported for Minecraft 1.15.2 and older!
{: .notice--warning }

Before you install 5zig, make sure that both the Game and Launcher are closed.

To install 5zig on your Vanilla Minecraft, double-click the downloaded Jar-file to execute it.  
If you get a Prompt to "Choose a program to open this file" and there is no Java option, [download and install Java](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).  
If the Jar is opened in WinRAR, 7Zip or similar, close the window and right-click the Jar followed by clicking on "Run > Java" (Or similar).

Once the installation is complete, start your Launcher, select the newly created 5zig Profile (if it isn't already pre-selected) and start it.

### Forge / Fabric
> **Notes:**
> 
> - The Forge version only supports Minecraft 1.8.9 and 1.12.2!
> - The Fabric version only supports Minecraft 1.15.2 (See the note at the top for info on 1.16+ support)
{: .notice--warning }

Forge and Fabric share the same installation process which is as follows:  
Once you downloaded the matching jar file for either Forge or Fabric, head over to your mods folder (Usually located under `.minecraft`) and place the jar in it.  
You can then start the Forge/Fabric profile in your Launcher and the 5zig Mod should be loaded.

Do NOT double-click (execute) the Jar-file itself!
