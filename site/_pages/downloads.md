## Latest stable Release
These releases are handpicked and considered to be the most stable when a milestone was reached.  
However, you should use the [latest build](#latest-build-recommended) instead.

## Cape-Template
If you're a Patreon donator will you have the option to upload a custom Cape file to use.  
Supported are both static Capes and animated ones. Note that animated capes are still PNG files with each separate frame set as another section within the file and that the animation runs at a set speed.

If you want to design your own cape can you click the button below to download a Zip-File with Template files in them.  
There are currently files for Gimp, Pain.net and Photoshop. The raw PNG files are also provided.

## How to Install
Don't know how to install 5zig? These guides can help you!

### Vanilla
> **Note:**  
> This is only supported for Minecraft 1.15.2 and older!
{: .notice--warning }

Before you install 5Zig, make sure that both the Game and Launcher are closed.

To install 5Zig on your Vanilla Minecraft, double-click the downloaded Jar-file to execute it.  
If you get a Prompt to "Choose a program to open this file" and there is no Java option, [download and install Java](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).  
If the Jar is opened in WinRAR, 7Zip or similar, close the window and right-click the Jar followed by clicking on "Run > Java" (Or similar).

Once the installation is complete, start your Launcher, select the newly created 5Zig Profile (if it isn't already pre-selected) and start it.

### Forge
> **Note:**  
> This is only supported for Minecraft 1.8.9 and 1.12.2!
{: .notice--warning }

Once you downloaded the Forge version, drag and drop it into the `mods` folder of your forge-profile (Usually `.minecraft/mods`).  
Do NOT execute (double-click) the Jar-file itself!

For more info about Forge including how to install and use it, please visit the [Forge Website](https://files.minecraftforge.net/).

### Fabric
Once you downloaded the Fabric version, drag and drop it into the `mods` folder of your Fabric-Profile (Usually `.minecraft/mods`).  
Do NOT execute (double-click) the Jar-file itself!
