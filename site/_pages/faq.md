# What is this?
This is the 5zig Mod you know and love, but with updates and addted functionality after the original author 5zig ended support for it.

# Are you 5zig?
No.  
We are a group of developers working on this as a hobby project.  
If you want to contact the original author, do so [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/the5zig).

# Can I get my Cape back?
No, or at least not yet.  
If you had a cape in the old 5zig Mod will you unfortunately not get one for free in 5zig Reborn.

# How do I get a cape?
By donating.  
You currently can donate using [Patreon](https://patreon.com/5zig) and after you pledged can you login to the Panel (In the mod go to `The 5zig Mod > Chat`) and connect your Patreon account. Afterwards can you get your cape.

# Will I lose my cape when I stop pledging?
No. After you first donation passed successfully will you keep the cape-feature.  
(We would still appreciate if you stay a Patreon tho...)

# When will you support Version X?
We don't know.  
5zig Reborn is a Hobby Project maintained by people in their spare, free time, so it's not sure when a new version can be supported.  
Additionally will we need to wait for external sources (Fabric) to be updated too in order to support the new version.

# Is the Mod Open-Source?
Yes it is!
