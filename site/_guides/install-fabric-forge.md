{: .notice--info }

Before installing 5zig, make sure that you have installed Fabric or Forge first, depending on which 5zig jar you downloaded.  
Once you installed Fabric/Forge, head over to the `mods` folder (Usually directly located under `.minecraft`) and drag the 5zig jar file into it.

You can now execute the Fabric/Forge Profile in your Launcher and the mod should load like normal.

Do NOT double-click the jar file itself!

Please visit the [official Forge Website](https://minecraftforge.net) or the [official Fabric Website](https://fabricmc.net) for more information about Forge or Fabric respectively.
