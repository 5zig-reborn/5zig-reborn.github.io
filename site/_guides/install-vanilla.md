Before you start the installation, make sure that there is no Game or Launcher running.

To install the mod, simply double-click the jar you downloaded and select the folder where you want to install it followed by clicking on `Install`.  
On the next screen can you now select other mods that you want to install too, or continue by clicking on `Install` again.

The game should now be installed and a new 5zig Reborn Profile should be available within the Launcher to select and execute.

## Troubleshooting
If you get a prompt similar to `Choose a program to open this file` and there is no Java option to select, make sure to [download and install Java](https://adoptopenjdk.net) and try again.  
If however, the double-clicking of the jar opens it in 7Zip or WinRAR, close the window and right-click the Jar followed by `Run -> Java` (May look different depending on your OS and version).
